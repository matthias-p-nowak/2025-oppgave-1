# Intention

This repository was created to deliver the results of an assignment to a potential employer.
Both the task and the employer are not disclosed.

# License

The intention is to include Yolo from ultralytics, hence the AGPL 3 license. 
This work can be used as proof of concept, proof of knowledge. 
Real production code has to switch the license to a commercial one, with the implied costs. 

# Build instructions

* The 3rdparty directory needs to be there with the required content.
* Bridge requires a nuget package with the correct version of System.Drawing.Image.
